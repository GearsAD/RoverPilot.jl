# RoverPilot.jl

A Brookstone rover library derived from the Python library [RoverPylot](https://github.com/simondlevy/RoverPylot), which is stored as a snapshot in the 'RoverPylot' folder.

This is currently an application and it is being refactored to convert it to a Julia library. Also removing the Kafka and CloudGraphs integration.
