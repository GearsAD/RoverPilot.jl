# RoverPilot.jl

A Brookstone rover library derived from the Python library [RoverPylot](https://github.com/simondlevy/RoverPylot), which is stored 'RoverPylot' folder because it's slightly modified from Simondlevy's original version. This library should function with Brookstone Rover 2s as well as with Rover Revolutions.

WIP - This is currently an application and it is being refactored to convert it to a Julia library. Also removing the Kafka and CloudGraphs integration.
